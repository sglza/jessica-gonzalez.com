# Digital Portfolio - Jessica Gonzalez

09 Jul 2020

## Project Description

This project is a refresh of the old digital portfolio of the photographer Jessica Gonz√°lez, which you can visit at www.jessica-gonzalez.com.

The previous design didn't take into consideration the wide variety of screen sizes that exist today. The goal was to give the website a more modern feel and to implement a liquid design, while keeping the minimalistic look.

PHP was used since the live website includes an admin page from where new series of photos can be uploaded, and are then altered by the server with the help of the ``imagick`` extension through the ``ImageMagick`` API.

Below are two comparisons between the previous and the current website, showcasing the main differences in a desktop and mobile view.
